### 👨‍💻 About Me

- 🔧 I build whatever I like – mostly small tools, some actually useful
- 🧨 Love breaking/cracking other people's tools for fun
- 💀 5-year FiveM server dev – solo project, died due to no funding
- 🤘 Solo dev only – hate "taowork" teams where 1 dude carries everything
- 🧠 Ideas come randomly, I build as I go

### ☕ My Dev Habits

- 🧠 Used to write Lua, now addicted to Python for how lazy it lets me be
- 🦉 Sleep cycle? What's that? I code from 11PM to 5AM and nap when I can
- 🎧 Coding with music and NSFW artwork in the background (don’t judge)
- 🏋️‍♂️ Chill time = gym time. Painful, but peaceful.
